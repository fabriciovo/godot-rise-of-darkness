## Story

### The Dark Lord  
A once‑noble Guardian has fallen, becoming the fearsome Dark Lord. He has unleashed a wave of terror, summoning creatures from the depths to ravage the realm. With darkness consuming the land, only you can rise against his reign and fight for the survival of humanity.

### The Hero  
You are the last Guardian of Light. Stripped of much of your former power after the fall of your brothers and sisters, you must embark on a perilous journey to reclaim your strength and confront the Dark Lord. Armed with courage, a sharp blade, and ancient magic, your resolve will be tested—yet the light you carry within may be strong enough to extinguish the growing shadows.
